# Upgrade rook-ceph from v1.11.x to v1.14.x

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Check the state of rook-ceph so it is healthy before you begin:

    ```bash
    helm -n rook-ceph list --all
    # should show all deployed
    kubectl -n rook-ceph get jobs
    # should show all completed
    kubectl -n rook-ceph get pods
    # should show all running or completed
    kubectl -n rook-ceph get cephclusters
    # should show PHASE = Ready and HEALTH = HEALTH_OK
    # If the status is not OK, you can extract some more information with the commands below.
    kubectl exec -n rook-ceph deploy/rook-ceph-toolbox -- ceph health detail
    kubectl exec -n rook-ceph deploy/rook-ceph-toolbox -- ceph status
    ```

## Apply upgrade to 1.12.x - _disruptive_

- 1. Fetch chart version:

    ```console
    rm -rf helmfile.d/upstream
    helm fetch rook-release/rook-ceph --version v1.12.11 --untar --destination helmfile.d/upstream
    helm fetch rook-release/rook-ceph-cluster --version v1.12.11 --untar --destination helmfile.d/upstream
    ```

    To give time for the operator to update internal objects, such as CRDs.
    We run the upgrade in two steps.

- 1. Upgrade rook-ceph operator:

    ```console
    helmfile -e workload -l app=operator diff
    helmfile -e workload -l app=operator apply
    ```

- 1. Upgrade rook-ceph cluster

    Wait a short while for the operator, before upgrading the cluster.

    ```console
    helmfile -e workload -l app=cluster diff
    helmfile -e workload -l app=cluster apply
    ```
