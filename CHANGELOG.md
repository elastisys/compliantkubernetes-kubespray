## v2.21.0-ck8s1 - 2023-02-06

### Release notes

- This version upgrades Kubernetes to `v1.25` in which Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are removed. You should not upgrade to this version if you are using PSPs. To deploy [Compliant Kubernetes Apps](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps) on this version it needs to be on a compatible version which depends on [this issue](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/issues/1218).
- This version requires at least terraform `0.14.0` in order to provision infrastructure using the kubespray provided terraform modules.
- If you are using the rook-ceph operator you can read the [migration docs](rook/migration/rook-1.5.x-rook-1.10.5/upgrade.md) on how to upgrade these components.

### Fixed

- Changed a Kubespray variable which is required for upgrading clusters on cloud providers that don't have external IPs on their control plane nodes.

### Changed

- Changed terraform scripts for openstack to be able to setup additional server groups and override variables per instance.
- Enabled the `ceph` dashboard for better visibility and troubleshooting of `rook-ceph`
- Upgraded rook-ceph operator to `v1.10.5` and ceph to `v17.2.5`
- Now defaulting to serial execution when running the upgrade playbook.
- Switched from using upstream kubespray repo to the elastisys fork.

### Added

- Added a get-requirements file to standardize which terraform version to use, `1.2.9`.
- Add ntp.se as ntp server as standard
- Added a script that creates a migration document from a template.

-------------------------------------------------
## v2.20.0-ck8s1 - 2022-10-10

-------------------------------------------------
## v2.19.0-ck8s2 - 2022-07-22

### Added

- Added a check to see if the status of the kubespray git submodule differs from the expected status to hinder that people apply a different kubespray version than they want by mistake.
- New playbook `playbooks/kubeconfig.yml` to manage kubeconfigs. It can either move the cluster admin kubeconfig that kubespray produces or create an OIDC kubeconfig. This comes with several new group vars.
- New playbook `playbooks/cluster_admin_rbac.yml` to add cluster admin RBAC for OIDC users. This comes with several new group vars.

### Changed

- Apply command uses the new ansible playbooks to manage kubeconfigs and OIDC clusteradmin RBAC.
