-------------------------------------------------
## v2.19.0-ck8s2 - 2022-07-22

### Added

- Added a check to see if the status of the kubespray git submodule differs from the expected status to hinder that people apply a different kubespray version than they want by mistake.
- New playbook `playbooks/kubeconfig.yml` to manage kubeconfigs. It can either move the cluster admin kubeconfig that kubespray produces or create an OIDC kubeconfig. This comes with several new group vars.
- New playbook `playbooks/cluster_admin_rbac.yml` to add cluster admin RBAC for OIDC users. This comes with several new group vars.

- Apply command uses the new ansible playbooks to manage kubeconfigs and OIDC clusteradmin RBAC.
